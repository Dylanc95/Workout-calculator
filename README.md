I forget the name of this workout routine, but it has worked out well for me. The instructions are as follows:

Figure out your max weights for bench press, shoulder press, deadlifts, and back squats. I have front squats on there as I don't have access to a squat rack right now. There are plenty of tutorials online to figure these exercises out, and a personal trainer is a good idea
if you're starting out brand new. If you're worried about going too light or too heavy, err on the lighter side. You'll catch up. 

Once you've figured out your max weights, you'll need to add what week you're on. This program works in 4 week blocks. The first week you'll be doing 3 sets of 5 reps of your given exercises at the weights listed. The last set should be as many reps as possible with a 
minimum of 5 reps. 
The second week will be 3 sets of 3 reps each, with the last set being AMRAP. 
The third week will be sets of 5, 3, and 1 with this set being AMRAP. This will be your heaviest week.
You'll notice the final week is very light comparitively. This is your deload week, no AMRAP sets. DO NOT SKIP THIS WEEK. It is essential to your recovery and will help you lift even heavier the following month. 

Once the fourth week is done you'll start back over on week 1, this time adding 10 lb to your upper body workout maxes and 20 lb to your lower body maxes. I.E. if you were pushing 135 lb on your bench press, now you'll be doing 145 lb. Keep going just like this and you'll
be amazed at how strong you feel in a year's time.
